# ![W](static/favicon.png) Joey's Wordle Solver

This is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) + [Yew](https://yew.rs/) [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) 
web-app which implements an interactive [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
solver, described originally by [Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)'s 
[video on wordle](https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA).

It's running live on my site, at [https://wordle.joey.sh](https://wordle.joey.sh) where you can
try it out. It's best viewed on a desktop, and works in recent versions of all major browsers.
